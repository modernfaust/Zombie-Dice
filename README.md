# Zombie-Dice
A recreation of the Zombie Dice game using in C++, with command line prompt for user entry.

This is an incredibly old project, which I used to teach myself about OOP. Obviously the inheritance hierarchy here could use some brushing up, and the limited functionality of this whole project could be extended.

This could also do well with a simple GUI library.
